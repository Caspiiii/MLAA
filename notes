Every input represents one edge. This each can be derived from a different instance -> Maybe consider adding additional input that represents the form of the solution.

For creation of labels -> 100 solutions. calculate the weighted average. First get the solution. How to proper structure output files?
The lables need vertices/edges as basis. can just be created with index.

Extract both objective funciton and edges that are in the solution. we need the relative weighting beforehand therefore we
have to iterate through the files twice. ones to get all object functions and second to calculate the actual pseudo labels
